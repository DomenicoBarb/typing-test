## React Typing Test App!

## Description
This is a Typing Test using React! This test randomly pulls 180 words from an array and displays them on screen to be typed within 60 seconds. With a dynamic highlighting system you can follow along with the text as you type. Once the timer runs out you will be given your score and the option to play again. You will also see some metrics on your typing speed and accuracy. This app is styled to work on mobile as well but given the nature of the app and mobile keyboards it does complicate things a bit. I would recommend using a desktop or laptop for the best experience.
