## Typing test app!

## Description
This is a Typing Test using React! This test randomly pulls 180 words from an array and displays them on screen to be typed within 60 seconds. With a dynamic highlighting system you can follow along with the text as you type. Once the timer runs out you will be given your score and the option to play again. You will also see some metrics on your typing speed and accuracy.
